<h1>Due dates on assessments</h1>
<h3>Why the due dates on assessments should be staggered</h3>
<div style="display:table-row">
    <div class="part left">
        <h3>Current Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Students have to deal with massive waves of assessments each year
                all due in waves of 3-6, which builds tones of stress, and having to switch between multiple assessments,
                all which makes focusing hard.
            </li>
            <li>
                If students are unable to focus, it means that the time it takes to complete a assessment will increase,
                as there are more assessments each year, and less time to do them, which all cause grades to go down.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="part right">
        <h3>What is the effect of the change</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Spread out due dates means that students can focus on a singular assessment at a time,
                rather than having to submit 4 or 5 different assessments at the same time.
            </li>
            <li>
                If due dates are spread out, Students get to have more time with their parents,
                as students can complete their assessments faster with more time on a single one
            </li>
        </ul>
